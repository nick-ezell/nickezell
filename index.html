        <p id="p1">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a twenty-four year old coding student in the Houston Coding Bootcamp through UT
            of Austin. I came to find
            an interest and passion for coding, through a friend, after they entered the industry and have enjoyed it ever
            since!
        
            For as long as I can remember I've always thought about things in a logical and rational kind of way.
            Coding, in that regard, is something that has greatly resonated with me and - as such - I seek to actively and continually grow by increasing my sphere of knowledge and applicable skills.
            I want to work in an environment where I will not only thrive and excel, but also be able to see tangible
            results and progress in projects I work on; I feel the world of code is such an environment.
