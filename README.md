    I tried to forgo the use of multiple css files here just to show to myself that I could, weird I know.
        I do realize, after the fact, that some of my code is a little superfluous and/or convoluted  while either being accomplished somewhere else or having no effect due to other inherited properties. This was an undertaking I tasked myself with knowing there would be difficulties. 
        The tutorial I saw said to go with a "mobile-first" design, so as to make it easier, but I already had my Desktop layout finished, so I did it in reverse, down to Mobile! 

    This is the result!
    Beginnings are rough.
